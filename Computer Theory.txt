no attendence
	possible suprise assignments if attendence is too low
similar exams between quarters

work with others to compare answers and talk about it
	probably should work them for a few hours alone first

NO LAPTOPS

Computer Science
is it a science?
what is a science?
	scientific method
		hypothesis - "educated guess"
		experimentation - try and prove hypothesis false
		becomes a theory - best understanding of something
	    extremely weak tool
	Mike's Definition of science
		Science is the process of creating analyzing, and revising abstract models of reality
		which are used to explain past and present observations and predict future events

3 models of computing
	Finite Automata
		Finite number of states
		can actually exist
	Pushdown Automata
		Finite Automata + 1 stack
			stack is infinite
	Turing Machines
		Finite Automata + a tape of infinite length
			"infinite memory"
true/false
cause/effect
	cant actually show cause and effect can only show correlation

this class
Linguistics
	syntax of language
	Noam Chomsky
		context free grammar
	BNF - Syntax for language
Nural Nets - regular expressions
Mathematics

David Hilbert
	1862-1943
	algarithms
Kurt Godel 
	1906-1978
	1: no algorithm can produce proofs for all true statements
	2: not all true statements have a proof
		either some true things can't be proven, or some false things can be proven true
